CSV workflow

-Use only meeting locations that are not TBA, web-only, off-campus, or N/A
-Group Crosslist IDs cp.df.groupby('Crosslist_ID')
-reindex df by crosslist

Row by row

crosslist.Actual_Enrl.sum() gives us the total number of students in the class

There's already a % capacity for classes!

classroom_list
---------------
Room is Building Name
Room.1 is Room Number

Need to concatenate Room and Room.1
df["Meeting_Location"] = df["Room"] + " " + df["Room.1"]
>>> result = pd.merge(df2, df, left_on=df2.Meeting_Location_1, right_on=df.Meeting_Location, how='inner')

#df['Xlst_Max_Enrl'] = df['Xlst_Max_Enrl'].apply(lambda x: x if (x != '') else '0')
